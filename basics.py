Three quotations begins/ends a multi-line comment to be used for documenation 
(also known as a doc string).
Include one of these at the beginning of every py file to give a brief description
of what the code contains, who wrote it, etc. Also include one of these at the 
beginning of every function definition to explain what the function does.

This script shows some very basic parts of Python. Run it using the command
"python basics.py" in a terminal.
